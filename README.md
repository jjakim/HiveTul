HiveTul
=======

A port of the HiveTool into perl.
It began as a discussion with the original author (villagefool) without whom, I would not have tackled this project. He questioned his current code language, I said I thought the mix was right. But like so much else, I could not stop thinking about it. So I thought to take a crack at it.
The name is a corruption of the original name.
